# ESP32_Bad-Apple
An ESP32 Playing Bad Apple on a 0.96" OLED

## Note
Use an ESP32 or any MCU that is arduino programmable and is compatible with used libraries with 4MB or more flash (The flash size is 2.7MB because of the large amount of frames).This project was only tested in an ESP32-S3 Dev Board with 16MB flash(ESP32-S3-N16R8).
