(Not actual hardware, Only a virtual visualization)

## Note
Use an ESP32 or any MCU that is arduino programmable and is compatible with used libraries with 4MB or more flash (The flash size is 2.7MB because of the large amount of frames).This project was only tested in an ESP32-S3 Dev Board with 16MB flash(ESP32-S3-N16R8).If you're still getting an error saying space is not enough even though you have more than 4MB of flash storage, In Arduino IDE, Go to Tools and then Partition scheme then Select anything that is above 2MB(Only tested in ESP32 dev board).
